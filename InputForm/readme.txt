Use Eclipse to run an apache tomcat server
hosting "Project1." Use a web browser to view
http://localhost:8080. This will take you to the
input form. Enter in the desired parameters and
press submit. Form data will be printed out in
the console. The relevant Java class is
Project1/src/TestServlet.java. The variables
containing the relevant information should be
rather clear.
